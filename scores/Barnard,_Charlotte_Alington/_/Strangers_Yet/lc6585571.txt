Stangers yet, after years of life together, After fair and stormy weather, After travel in far lands, After touch of wedded hands Why thus joined, why ever met? If they must be strangers yet, strangers yet, strangers yet! After childhood’s winning ways, After care and blame and praise, Counsel ask’d and wisdom giv’n After mutual pray’rs to Heav’n, Child and parent scarce regret, When they part are strangers yet. strangers yet. stran gers yet. Will it ever more be thus, Spirits still impervi ous? Shall we never fairly stand Soul to soul, as hand to hand? Are the bounds eternal set To retain us strangers yet, stran gers yet, stran gers yet!

Our village was sad when the soldiers came, But we hadn’t the heart our lads to blame, For what with the drums and the ribbons gay, The soldiers flatter’d their hearts away. Although the neighbours bitterly cried, And many a heart was sad beside, But mine methought was the saddest of all, As I watch’d them away at the even fall; Tho’ I laugh’d and I told them to let me be, For I know that our Mark will be true to me; Tho’ I laugh’d and I told them to let me be, For I know that our Mark will be true to me. To fight in the battles it was too bad They should come for a harmless village lad, To take him away from his friends and home, And carry him o’er the salt sea foam. Oh! would those drums had never come near, For Mark was happy and peaceful here; Content to follow his father’s plough. Oh! I wish in my heart he was after it now; Tho’ I laugh and I tell them to let me be, For I know that our Mark will be true to me; Tho’ I laugh and I tell them to let me be, For I know that our Mark will be true to me. But summer has gone, and a year has flown, Since we follow’d their marching o’er the down, And wherever they went is a puzzle to me, But I know that it’s somewhere across the sea. And Mark went marching off with the rest, And held up his head as well as the best; And if the battles be won, I know It is all thro’ persuading our Mark to go. So I laugh and I tell them to let me be, For I know that our Mark will be true to me; So I laugh and I tell them to let me be, For I know that our Mark will be true to me.

Ah! but Yet where would seem Erin to me.
I’m sailin’ away o’er the green sea tomorrow, I’m leavin’ the land o’ the shamrock behind; From Father and Mother I’m partin’ in sorrow, And och! I’ve a cravin’ to alter my mind. But yet could I bear ye to sail off without me, And didn’t I pro mise a true wife to be; Ah! I tell them I’ll never forsake ye or doubtye, Whereever thou art, would seem Erin to me. But Dermot, remember it’s all I am leavin’, And sure you’ll be lovin’ and tender as now; I know in my heart you would ne’er be deceivin’ The blessin’ o’ Heaven you call’d on the vow. But, darlin’, my tears have been bitter and many, It’s nigh upon breakin’, my heart seems to be, Ah! but still I’ll be thinkin’ I’m back in Kilkenny, Whereever thou art would seem Erin to me. Fare– well to the land o' my heart’s best affections, May angels be watchin’ the cabin I love, And bring to my dreams the belov’d resolution, Tho’ far from the mountain and valley I rove. Some day we’ll re,turn, if kind Heaven be willin’, Then happy my heart nigh to burstin’ will be, Yet wheree’er we may roam, and tho’ strange be the dwellin’, Whereever thou art would seem Erin to me.

I come from haunts of Coot and Hern, I make a sudden sally And sparkle out amid the fern, To bicker down the Valley. By thirty hills I hurry down Or slip beneath the ridges, By twenty thorps a little town And half a hundred bridges. Till last by Philips farm I flow, To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever Go on But I go on for ever Go on But I go on for ever. I steal by lawns and grassy plots, I slide by hazel covers; I move the sweet forgetmenots, That grow for happy lovers: I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance Among my skimming swallows, I make the netted sunbeam dance, Against my sandy shallows. And out again I curve and flow, To join the brimming river; For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever, Go on But I go on for ever Go on But I go on for ever.

Sleep, child, and may thy cradle be A ship upon ahalcyon sea, Gliding with silver sail unfurl’d Beyond the turmoil of the world. Sing tenderly, tenderly, Lullaby, lullaby, Sing tenderly, Lullaby. Oh! drift into some drowsy bay, Where only quiet dreams hold sway, Where healing herbs no pain allow, Where golden birds on bended bough Sing soothingly, soothingly, Lullaby, lullaby. Sing soothingly, Lullaby. Then wake, wake, my babe, and step ashore Into thy mother’s arms once more; And my life’s journeys ever end Upon the bosom of a friend, Sing, tenderly, tenderly, Lullaby, lullaby, Sing tenderly, Lullaby. Sing tenderly, tenderly, Lullaby, lullaby, Sing tenderly, Lullaby.

In the shade sits Robin Sly, Waiting there till Kate comes by; Lover’s quarrel has been rife, Robin vows that, ere it ends, Kate must kiss and make amends; “Wilful maid makes shrewish wife, wilful maid makes shrewish wife.” So says Robin, wise Sir Robin, Brave Robin Sly, Brave Robin Sly. But while Robin sits sedate, Who comes through the wicket gate? Who but Kate and Ploughman Joe? Kate that laughs at Robin Sly, Singing as she passes by, “Let him cool a year or so, let him cool a year or so.” Angry Robin, wistful Robin, Sad Robin Sly, sad Robin Sly. Joe the happiest husband thrives, Kate the most discreet of wives; So it is that in the wooing Maids must have the mastery, Men must wait till by and bye. Learning this was thy undoing, Learning this was thy undoing, Hasty Robin, foolish Robin, Poor Robin Sly, poor Robin Sly.

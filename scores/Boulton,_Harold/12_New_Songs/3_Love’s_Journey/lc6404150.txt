Moonbeam purest and serenest That from Heav’n’s pale vapour leanest, Shining earthward far away With thy lustrous silver ray, Shine on my beloved’s home, shine on my beloved’s home, Tell her, tell her swift as thee I come. Dawning sun, thou orb of wonder, Rolling sable clouds asunder, Shake the dun mist from thy brow, Rim with gold her dwelling now; Tell her, glorious messenger, tell her, glorious messenger, tell her how I haste to come to her. Night’s long journeyings are over, I am come to thee, dear lover, I am come, I am come to thee Here I wait at earliest dawn, ’Mid the roses on thy lawn, here I wait at earliest dawn ’mid the roses on thy lawn, here I wait ‘mid the roses. Open wide thy window, Sweet, open wide thy window, Sweet, Open wide, open wide! I am kneeling at thy feet, I am kneeling at thy feet.

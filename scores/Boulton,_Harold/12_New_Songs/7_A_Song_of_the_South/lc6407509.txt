I have a garden beautiful By a sea of peerless blue; There are sunny slopes and grottoes cool, And a streamlet wanders through. There are oranges and cypresses, there are vines, and olives grey, And soft winds rustling through the trees, That whisp’ring seem to say. “Come to my bounteous Paradise; My Eden of the South, Come with the lovelight in your eyes, Warm kisses on your mouth.” Thrill’d by the flowerscented gale, The sea and sky of blue, My trembling pulses start and fail, And faint, dear heart, for you. Shine through the air, a Vision fair, And make my dream, my dream come true!

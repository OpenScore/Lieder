Come, swallow, come, for thee we wait; Come, swallow, come, for thee we wait; Come seek thy northern home anew, Come seek thy northern home anew, Where pale spring flow’rs are delicate, And winter skies are changed to blue. Come, swallow, come, come, swallow, come, come, for thee we wait. Come, swallow, come, for thee we wait. Come, swallow, come, for thee we wait; The thatch is warm beneath the sun, the thatch is warm beneath the sun; Here tell of love to thy fond mate, Today should see thy nest begun; Come, swallow, come, come, swallow, come, come, for thee we wait: Come, swallow, come, for thee we wait; The spring is perfect but for thee. Ah! welcome, though thou speedest late, Thy truant wings from o’er the sea, Welcome, ah! welcome, Welcome, O swallow, welcome, o swallow, for not in vain we wait, for not in vain we wait.

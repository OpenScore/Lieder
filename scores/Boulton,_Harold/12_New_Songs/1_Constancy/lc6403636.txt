My heart that burns like the noontide Has waited the long day through, And still in the gloaming I long for your coming, As flow’rs faint for the dew, I long, I long for your coming, As flow’rs faint for the dew. Oh! come in the cool, the cool of the ev’ning, Like a soft wind out of the west; Oh! come like the swallow that flies o’er the fallow, Homeward at night to the nest, Homeward at night to the nest. The nightingale in the garden Cries “Look, look, look, truant love;” “The pale stars glimmer, the moonbeams shimmer and glide through the leaves above, glide through the leaves above.” Ah me! Ah me! Ah me, but the midnight passes, I linger and know not why; Though you come never, I hope for ever, A lover must hope or die, For a lover must hope or die; Though you come never, I hope for ever, For a lover must hope or die.

When I was oneandtwenty I heard a wise man say, “Give crowns and pounds and guineas But not your heart away; Give pearls away and rubies But keep your fancy free.” But I was oneandtwenty, No use to talk to me. When I was oneandtwenty, I heard him say again, “The heart out of the bosom Was never given in vain; ’Tis paid with sighs a plenty And sold for endless rue.” And I am twoandtwenty, And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true, ’tis true.

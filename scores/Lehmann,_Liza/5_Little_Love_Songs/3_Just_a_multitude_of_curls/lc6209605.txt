Just a multitude of curls Weighing down a little head; Two wide eyes, not blue nor gray, Like the sky ’twixt night and day, Small red mouth – and all to say Has been said. Just a saucy word or glance And a hand held out to kiss; Just a curl  – a ribbon through  – Just a flower  — fresh and blue  — And to think what men will do Just for this!

There’s a bird beneath your window, There’s a sunbeam that slips in, There’s a rose bush in your garden Where a spider learns to spin. And we’re all in league against you, Bird and flow’r and gold sundart, And the web the spider’s spinning Is the mesh to hold your heart  — Is the mesh to hold your heart.

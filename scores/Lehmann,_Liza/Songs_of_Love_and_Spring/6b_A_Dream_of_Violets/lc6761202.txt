The scent of violets, by my pillow blowing, So stole upon my senses that I dreamed; Methought, along a mountain pathway going, I came where fragrant hosts of violets gleamed. So thick they grew, such heav'nly perfume strowing, A very Paradise on earth it seemed. Then spoke my heart: "Her eyes have rested yonder, And left wheree'er they shone this violet wonder"

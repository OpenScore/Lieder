I am the rose upon the mead in silent fragrance flow’ring
spread me, But thine the steadfast hand that stayed, And into daylight led me
I am the rose upon the mead, In silent fragrance flow’ring, But Love’s the dew with pearly bead Upon my petals show’r– ing. I am the cup of crystal shine, Before a monarch gleaming, But Love’s the rosy nectar wine In– to the goblet streaming. I am the rose up– on the mead, In silent fragrance flow’ring!
I was the rugged jasper stone That in the earth lay darkling, And thou the light, and thou alone, That set its colours sparkling. I was a mortal sore dismayed, such darkness overspread me, But thine the steadfast hand that stayed, And into daylight led me, thine the steadfast hand that stayed, And into daylight led me!

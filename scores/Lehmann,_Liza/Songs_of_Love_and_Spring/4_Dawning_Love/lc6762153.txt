orbs di  – lake and
A ray from out the ruby, It sparkles and is fled, A jet of fiery purple! And lo! the grape is sped. But through the dusky lashes, That fringe your orbs divine, The dawning lovelight flashes, And thrills this heart of mine,__ ’Tis dawning love that flashes, And thrills this heart of mine Since first you looked up– on me, And looked my heart a– way, My thoughts have never rested For longing, night and day. As homing swallows flutter O’er woodland, lake andlea, They soar and fly for ever, To thee, alone to thee,–– They soar and fly for ever, To thee, alone to thee, And though the mountains were golden, And though the rivers ran wine, I’d pass them all by, my beloved, I’d pass them to make thee mine!

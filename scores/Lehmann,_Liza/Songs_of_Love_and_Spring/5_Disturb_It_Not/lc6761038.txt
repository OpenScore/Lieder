When first the lamp of love is lit, With– in a maiden heart to hide, Ah, never quench the tender flame That Heav’n itself has sanctified. If under God’s own courts above There yet remains one holy spot, It is the heart of first true love Dis– turb it not! Disturb it not! Oh darken not those rainbow skies, In– vade ye not that dream of May, Ye know not what a Paradise For evermore might pass away. When first the lamp of love is lit, Within a maiden heart to hide, Ah, never quench the tender flame That Heav’n itself has sanctified. Disturb it not!

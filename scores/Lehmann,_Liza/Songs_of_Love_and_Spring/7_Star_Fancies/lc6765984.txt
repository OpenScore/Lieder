Are the stars that beam above us When the sunset fades from Heav’n, Shining flocks by Night, the Shepherd, Through the fields of azure driv’n? Are they hosts of silver lilies, From their crystalchaliced flow’rs Wafting streams of blest oblivion To this toiling world of ours? Are they myriad clust’ring candles Twinkling out at Heav’n’s high Altar, That across the dome of darkness Through the holy stillness falter? No! they are love’s silent music, Shining out at Heav’n’s blue portal, In a thousand golden cyphers, Angel written and im– mortal!

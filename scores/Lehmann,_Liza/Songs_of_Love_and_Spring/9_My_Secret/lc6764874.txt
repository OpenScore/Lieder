O hasten your speed, my steed, my steed, My heart no longer can tarry, To the wood, to the wood, to the far green wood, My joyous secret to carry! O were I upward thro' ether drawn, Like the skylark soaring, and soaring, How would I sing to the rosy dawn, My joy, my joy outpouring. O hasten your speed, my steed, my steed, My heart no longer can tarry, To the wood, to the wood, to the far green wood, My joyous secret to carry! No wings are mine with the lark on high to soar where no mortal is near me, I cannot sing to the rosy sky, The earth, the earth must hear me. Then hearken, oh forest, and share my bliss, For past is my passionate yearning; She is mine! She is mine! She is mine! Her virgin kiss upon my lips upon my lips is burning!

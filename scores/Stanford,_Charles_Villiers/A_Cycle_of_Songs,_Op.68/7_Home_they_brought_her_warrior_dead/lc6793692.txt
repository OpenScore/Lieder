Home they brought her warrior dead. She nor swoon’d, nor utter’d cry: All her maidens, watching, said, 'She must weep or she will die.' Then they praised him, soft and low, Called him worthy to be loved, Truest friend and noblest foe; Stole a maidden from her place, Lightly to the warrior stept, Took the facecloth from the face; Rose a nurse of ninety years, Set his child upon her knee, Like summer tempest came her tears “Sweet my child, I live for thee.”

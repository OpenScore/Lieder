Fair Daffodils, we weep to see You haste away so soon; As yet the early rising sun Has not attain’d his noon. Stay, stay Until the hasting day Has run But to the evensong; And, having pray’d together, we Will go with you along. We have short time to stay, as you, We have as short a spring; As quick a growth to meet decay, As you, or anything. We die As your hours do, and dry Away, Like to the summer rain, Or as the pearls of morning’s dew, Ne’er to be found again.

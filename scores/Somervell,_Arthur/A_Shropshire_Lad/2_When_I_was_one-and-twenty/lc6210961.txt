When I was oneandtwenty I heard a wise man say, ‘Give crowns and pounds and guineas But not your heart away; Give pearls away and rubies But keep your fancy free.’ But I was oneandtwenty No use to talk to me. When I was oneandtwenty I heard him say again, ‘The heart out of the bosom Was never given in vain; ’Tis paid with sighs aplenty, And sold for endless rue.’ And I am twoandtwenty, And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.

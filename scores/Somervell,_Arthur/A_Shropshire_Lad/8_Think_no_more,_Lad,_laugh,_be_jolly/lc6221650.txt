Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly; Why should men make haste to die? Empty heads and tongues atalking Make the rough road easy walking, And the feather pate of folly Bears the falling sky. Oh, ’tis jesting, dancing, drinking Spins the heavy world around. If young hearts were not so clever, Oh, they would be young for ever; Think no more: ’tis only thinking Lays lads underground. Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly; Why should men make haste to die? Empty heads and tongues atalking Make the rough road easy walking, And the feather pate of folly Bears the falling sky.

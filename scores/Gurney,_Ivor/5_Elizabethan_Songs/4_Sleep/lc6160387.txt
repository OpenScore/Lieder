Come, Sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving Lock me in delight awhile; Let some pleasing dream beguile all my fancies; that from thence I may feel an influence All my powers of care bereaving! Though but a shadow, but a sliding, Let me know some little joy! We that suffer long annoy Are contented with a thought Through an idle fancy wrought: O let my joys have some abiding! O let my joys have some abiding!

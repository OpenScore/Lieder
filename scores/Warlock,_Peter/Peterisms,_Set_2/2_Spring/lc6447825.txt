Spring, the sweet spring is the year’s pleasant king, Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring, Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing Cuckoo, jug jug, pu we, to witta woo! The palm and may make country houses gay, Lambs frisk and play, the shepherd’s pipe all day, And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay, Cuckoo, jug jug, pu we, to witta woo. The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet, Young lovers meet, old wives asunning sit, In every street these tunes our ears do greet, Cuckoo, jug jug, puwe, to witta woo! Spring, The sweet Spring!

There is a lady sweet and kind, Was never face so pleased my mind, I did but see her passing by, And yet I love her till I die. Her gesture, motion and her smiles, Her wit, her voice my heart beguiles; Beguiles my heart, I know not why, And yet I love her till I die. Cupid is wing√®d, and doth range, Her country so my love doth change: But change she earth or change she sky, Yet will I love her till I die.

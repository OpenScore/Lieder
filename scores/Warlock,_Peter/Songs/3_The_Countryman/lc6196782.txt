Oh, the sweet contentment The countryman doth find. High trolollie lollie loe, High trolollie lie! That quiet contemplation Possesseth all my mind: Then care away And wend along with me. For courts are full of flattery, As hath too oft been tried; High trolollie lollie loe, High trolollie lie! The city full of wantonness, And both are full of pride. Then care away And wend along with me. But oh, the honest countryman Speaks truly from his heart, High trolollie lollie loe, High trolollie lie! His pride is in his tillage, His horses and his cart: Then care away And wend along with me. The ploughman, though he labour hard, Yet on his holiday, High trolollie lollie loe, High trolollie lie! No emperor so merrily Does pass his time away; Then care away and wend along with me.

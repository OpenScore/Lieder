Golden slumbers kiss your eyes, Smiles awake you when you rise. Sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry, And I will sing a lullaby, Rock them, rock a lulla, lullaby. Care is heavy, therefore sleep you You are care, and care must keep you Sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry, And I will sing a lullaby, rock them, Rock a lulla, lullaby.

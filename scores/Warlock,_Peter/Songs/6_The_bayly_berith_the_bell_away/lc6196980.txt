The maidens came when I was in my mother’s bow’r. I had all that I would. The bayly berith the bell away, The lily, the rose, the rose I lay. The silver is white, Red is the gold, The robes they lay in fold. The bayly berith the bell away, The lily, the rose, the rose I lay. And through the glass window shines the sun. How should I love and I so young? The bayly berith the bell away; The lily, the lily, the rose I lay.

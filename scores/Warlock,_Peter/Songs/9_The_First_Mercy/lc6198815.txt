Ox and ass at Bethlehem On a night, ye know of them. We were only creatures small, hid by shadows on the wall. We were swallow, moth and mouse; The Child was born in our house. And the bright eyes of us three Peeped at His nativity. Hands of peace upon that place Hushed our beings for... a space Quiet feet and folded wing, Nor a sound of anything. With a moving star we crept Closer when the Baby slept Men who guarded where He lay Moved to frighten us away. But the Babe, awakened, laid Love on things that were..... afraid; With so sweet a gesture He Called us to His company.

For all the wonder of thy regal day, Golden content, golden content, and Freedom that can dare to covet not, nor shun a grander sway, And knowledge soaring to a loftier air, We bend, we bend to Thee, we bend to The that thou hast been Of sea and land illustrious Queen, illustrious Queen. But rather for the mind that can rejoice with all our joy, and strive as we have striven, Ripe human counsel, and the nearer voice Of comfort to the lowly mourner given, We cling, we cling to this, we cling to this that thou hast been In heart and home our Mother Queen, our Mother Queen.

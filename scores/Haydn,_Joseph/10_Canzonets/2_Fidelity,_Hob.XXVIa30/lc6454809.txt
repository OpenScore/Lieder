While hollow burst the rushing winds, And heavy beats the show’r. This anxious, aching bosom finds No comfort in its pow’r; no, no! For ah! my Love, it little knows What thy hard fate may be, What bitter storms of fortune blow, What tempests trouble thee, what tempests trouble thee, what tempests trouble thee. A wayward fate hath spun the thread On which our days depend, And darkling in the chequer’d shade, She draws it to an end, But whatsoe’er may be our doom, The lot is cast for me, is cast for me, is cast for me; For in the world or in the tomb, My heart is fix’d on thee, is fix’d on thee, is fix’d on thee. For in the world or in the tomb, My heart is fix’d on thee, My heart is fix’d on thee, is fix’d on thee. For in the world, or in the tomb, my heart, my heart is fix’d on thee, My heart is fix’d on thee. But whatsoe’er may be our doom, The lot is cast for me, is cast for me, is cast for me; For in the world, or in the tomb, My heart is fix’d on thee, is fix’d on thee, is fix’d on thee. For in the world, or in the tomb, My heart is fix’d on thee, My heart is fix’d on thee is fix’d on thee. For in the world, or in the tomb, My heart, My heart is fix’d on thee, My heart is fix’d on thee, on thee, on thee, on thee, on thee.

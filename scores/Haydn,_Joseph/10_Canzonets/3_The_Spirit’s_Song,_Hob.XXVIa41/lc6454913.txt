Hark! Hark! what I tell to thee! Nor sorrow o'er the tomb, nor sorrow o'er the tomb; My Spirit wanders free, my Spirit wanders free, And waits, and waits till thine shall come. All pensive and alone, I see thee sit and weep, Thy heart upon the stone, Where my cold ashes sleep, where my cold ashes sleep. I watch thy speaking eyes, And mark each falling tear, I catch thy passing sighs, I catch thy passing sighs, Ere they are lost in air. Hark! Hark! what I tell to thee! Nor sorrow, nor sorrow o'er the tomb. My Spirit wanders free, my Spirit wanders free, And waits till thine shall come. My Spirit wanders free, And waits, and waits till thine shall come, till thine shall come.

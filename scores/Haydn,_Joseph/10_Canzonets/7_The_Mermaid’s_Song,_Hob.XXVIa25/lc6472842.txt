Now the dancing sunbeams play, On the green and glassy sea; Come and I will lead the way Where the pearly treasures be. Come and I will lead the way, Where the pearly treasures be: where the pearly treasures be, where the pearly treasures be. Come with me, and we will go, Where the rocks of coral grow, of coral grow. Follow, follow, follow me, follow, follow, follow me. Come with me, and we will go Where the rocks of coral grow. where the rocks of coral grow. Follow, follow, follow me, follow, follow, follow me. Come, behold what treasures lie Far below the rolling waves, Riches hid from human eye, Dimly shine in Ocean's caves. Ebbing tides bear no delay, Stormy winds are far away, stormy winds are far away, stormy winds are far away. Come with me, and we will go, Where the rocks of coral grow, of coral grow. Follow, follow, follow me, follow, follow, follow me. Come with me, and we will go Where the rocks of coral grow. where the rocks of coral grow. Follow, follow, follow me, follow, follow, follow me.

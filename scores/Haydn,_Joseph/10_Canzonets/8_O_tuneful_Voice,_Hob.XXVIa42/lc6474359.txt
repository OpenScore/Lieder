O tuneful voice! I still deplore thy accents, I still deplore, Which, though heard no more, Still vibrate on my heart; still vibrate on my heart. The accents which, though heard no more, Still vibrate on my heart. still vibrate on my heart, still vibrate on my heart. In Echo’s cave I long to dwell And still to hear that sad farewell, When we were forc’d to part, And still to hear that sad farewell, When we were forc’d to part, were forc’d to part. Bright Eyes! O that the task were mine To guard the liquid fires that shine, And round your orbits play! To watch them with a Vestal’s care To feed with smiles a light so fair That it might ne’er decay, that it might ne’er decay. To feed with smiles a light so fair That it might ne’er decay, that it might ne’er decay, that it might ne’er decay, that it might ne’er decay, that it might ne’er decay. that it might ne’er decay.

High on the giddy bending mast, The Seaman furls the rending sail; And fearless of the rushing blast, He careless whistles to the gale. Rattling ropes and rolling seas, Hurly burly, hurly burly. War, nor death can him displease, can him displease. Hurly burly, Hurly burly, hurly burly, hurly burly, War nor death can him displease, can him displease, can him displease. The hostile Foe his vessel seeks, High bounding o’er the raging main; The roaring cannon loudly speaks, ’Tis BRITAIN’S glory we maintain. ’Tis BRITAIN’S glory we maintain. Rattling ropes and rolling seas, Hurly burly, hurly burly, War nor death can him displease, can him displease. Hurly burly, hurly burly, hurly burly, hurly burly, War nor death can him displease, can him displease, can him displease.

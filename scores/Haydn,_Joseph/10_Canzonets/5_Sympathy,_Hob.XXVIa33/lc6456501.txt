In thee I bear so dear a part, By love so firm, so firm am thine, That each affection of thy heart, By sympathy is mine. That each affection, that each affection of my heart, By sympathy is mine, is mine, is mine. When thou art griev’d, I grieve no less, My joys, my joys by thine are known. And ev’ry good thou would'st possess Becomes in wish my own. And ev’ry good thou would’st possess, becomes becomes in wish my own. Becomes in wish my own, Becomes in wish my own.

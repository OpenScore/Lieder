The anguish of my bursting heart Till now my tongue hath ne’er betray’d, till now my tongue hath ne’er betray’d; Despair at length reveals the smart, despair at length reveals the smart. No time can cure, no hope can aid, no hope can aid. Despair at length reveals the smart, No time can cure, no hope can aid. My sorrows verging to the grave, No more shall pain thy gentle breast, no more shall pain thy gentle breast; Think, death gives freedom to the slave, think, death gives freedom to the slave. Nor mourn for me when I'm at rest, when I’m at rest. Think, death gives freedom to the slave, Nor mourn for me, when I'm at rest. Yet, if at eve you chance to stray Where silent sleeps the peaceful dead, where silent sleeps the peaceful dead; Give to your kind compassion way, give to your kind compassion way. Nor check the tears by pity shed, by pity shed. Give to your kind compassion way, Nor check the tears by pity shed. Whene’er the precious dewdrop falls, I ne’er can know, I ne’er can see, I ne’er can know, I ne’er can see; And if sad thought my fate recalls, and if sad thought my fate recalls, A sigh may rise unheard by me, unheard by me. And if sad thought my fate recalls, A sigh may rise unheard by me.
